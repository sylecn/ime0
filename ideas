GNU PDF

The goal of the GNU PDF project is to develop and provide a free,
high-quality, complete, and portable set of libraries and programs to manage
the PDF file format (ISO 32000), and associated technologies.

In the near future PDF 1.7 will become ISO 32000, an international standard,
and currently free software PDF programs support few of the features that PDF
files support. We believe that we urgently need a collection of free software
PDF libraries and programs that can fully implement this standard and provide
users with many of the features they are currently missing in their PDF
applications, such as support for interactive forms and JavaScript validation,
annotation support, and embedded movies and 3D artwork—just to name a few.

Ways to help: There are many opportunities for volunteers to help take part in
the creation of this project, from low-level C-programming, to high-level web
programming, from copyediting documentation, to creating artwork for use
throughout the applications, manuals, and software itself. Also, consider
making a directed donation through the FSF, directly to this project.
